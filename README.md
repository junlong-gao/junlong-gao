Welcome! I am a software engineer and have been working on distributed storage systems professionally. During my spare time, I enjoy venturing my own endeavor into recreational algorithmic challenges and many avenues in mathematics.

> It is true that Fourier had the opinion that the principal aim of mathematics was public utility and explanation of natural phenomena; but a philosopher like him should have known that the sole end of science is the honor of the human mind, and that under this title a question about numbers is worth as much as a question about the system of the world.

-- C.G.J. Jacobi, letter to Legendre, July 2, 1830, in Gesammelte Werke, Vol. I, Berlin (1881), p. 454.
